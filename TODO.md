## Graph class (*visual representation*)

- Graph size is currently fixed. It could be good to make it dynamic to the size of the window, maybe even with a minimum size for the nodes ;
- Allow to import files from the GUI, as well as export the graph/matrice as an image (or more, like SVG, Markdown, HTML, ... depending on if it's a graph or a matrice) ;
- Add a way to display weighted edges ;
