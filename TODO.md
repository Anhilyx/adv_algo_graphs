## Graph class (*visual representation*)

- Graph size is currently fixed. It could be good to make it dynamic to the size of the window, maybe even with a minimum size for the nodes ;
- Add more export formats ;
- Show weights on edges only when all weights are not equal to 0 or 1 ;
- Show direction on edges only when the graph has edge[i][j] != edge[j][i] ;
