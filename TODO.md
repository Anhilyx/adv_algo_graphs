## Graph class (*visual representation*)

- Nodes should be organised better, as there is a lot of lost space in this version ;
- A "file" menu should be added, allowing to select a matrice file instead of an hard-coded one ;
- Nodes should be movable, allowing to re-organize them for better visualisation ;
